### Yellow there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently undertaking IBM Software Engineering Specialization on Agile, Scrum and DevOps for TDD and CI/ CD.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning as it is a continuous process to evolve, BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything and everything as I am quite eclectic and ambitious.
- ðŸ¤” Up for help with GitHub as I lost my old account and have to start from 0 and with whatsoever you can offer.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Reversopedia and let us engage in a witty banter that is quite insighful and provides a comedic relief.
